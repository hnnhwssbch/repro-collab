Happy collaborations:

* don't fight with technology, they take advantage of it
* don't engage in edit wars, they have clear responsibilities

--

This is as much as a **technological** challange, as a **sociological** one.


---

Speaking of technology, why can't we use good old:

* Word
* Google Docs / Overleaf
* Google Collab
* Dropbox / Seafile etc.

---

# Word

.pull-left[

## Upside

* everyone can use it
* track changes

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* only one person at any given time
* no reproducibility

]

---

# Google Doc / Overleaf

.pull-left[

## Upside

* everyone can use it
* many people
* ~~track changes~~

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* anyone can edit everything, without anyone noticing
* no reproducibility

]

---

# Google Collab

.pull-left[

## Upside

* many people can edit
* track changes via GitHub
* reproducibility

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* track changes via GitHub

]

---

# Dropbox & Co

.pull-left[

## Upside

* anyone can use it
* reproducibility

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* only one person at any given time
* anyone can edit everything, without anyone noticing

]

---

# GitHub / GitLab

.pull-left[

## Upside

* reproducibility
* high level of control
* thousands of people can collaborate
* any collaboration workflow is possible

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* any collaboration workflow is possible
* highly complex

# Collaboration is hard

# Github is hard

# Alternatives are hard

## What's the first step of every epic collaboration?
Find a collaborator!

* Form a line by GitHub experience
  - Left end = novice (never touched GitHub)
  - Right end = expert (merge conflicts don’t scare me)
* Now split the line in half
  - First half moves left, second half stays
  - Voilà: pairs!

If you realize you don’t want to participate in the workshop, please step out now as otherwise your partner will be left hanging.

# This workshop is a beta version

Provide feedback: https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-collab/issues/new

---

---

## What makes an ideal issue?

--

The next step is clear.

1. Discussion
2. Decission
2. Implementation

---

## How can issues be used to organize tasks and responsibilities?

--

* people can voice their opinion in way that is documented
* mentioning via @username to trigger discussion/decision
* people can assign themselves or others

---

## How to get/provide feedback via GitHub?

--

* pull requests are ideally suited to get/provide feedback
* can be integrated into issues
* tracking other peoples contribution via PR is possible

---

## What aspects of your workflow are difficult to translate to GitHub?

---

## How much skill is required?

--

Either:

.pull-left[

**Git Wizard**


]

.pull-right[

**Project Organization Wizard**

]

--

Or some of both.

# Making a diff(erence)


* coordinate
* make atomic changes
* commit often, push less often
* use markdown everywhere
* when using markdown place each sentence on its own line
